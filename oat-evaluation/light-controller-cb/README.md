# Light controller

This is a small program that I use to control the remote controllable
switches of my apartment. I have a
[Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/)
running this program that connects to
[Telldus Tellstick Duo](http://telldus.se/produkt/tellstick-duo/). It
can control many types of 433.92 MHz remote controllable light
switches that I have peppered around my apartment.

The source code is documented in Finnish and not intended to be used
by any broader audience. Except maybe by a hostile neighbor who wants
to control my lights and loudspeakers at night.
