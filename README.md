# Prototype for OAT: Attesting Operation Integrity of Embedded Devices

This repository is a prototype implementation for our paper [OAT: Attesting Operation Integrity of Embedded Devices(Oakland'20)][1]. It contains the OAT Compiler (`oat-llvm40`), the OAT Trampoline Library (`oat-trampoline-lib`), the OAT Measurement Engine (`oat-measurement-engine-ta`), the OAT Verify Engine (`oat-verify-engine`), evaluation examples (`oat-evaluation`), and a few test programs for the OAT compiler (`oat-test`). 

OAT is an end-to-end remote attestation system that allows a verifier to attest the `control-flow integrity` and `critical data integrity` of a critical operation on a prover, which is usually a remotely deployed embedded device. You can check out our conference talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxS5AoyszP8). The OAT system architecture is shown as below:

## Contents

- `oat-llvm40`: OAT-Compiler based on llvm-4.0.0. It is used to analyze and instrument the embedded applications for critical data and control flow measurements. Modifications to the llvm front end are under `oat-llvm40/lib/Transforms/`, like `CFVHints/` and `Nova/`; modifications to the llvm back-end are under `oat-llvm40/lib/Target/AArch64/`, like `AArch64ControlFlowVerification.cpp` and `AArch64ControlFlowVerification.h`.  
- `oat-trampoline-lib`: OAT trampoline library, can be built as a shared library and linked with instrumented applications. It depends on the OP-TEE client library `libteec`.
- `oat-measurement-engine-ta`: OAT measurement engine, which is a trusted application (TA) runs inside the TEE. Build it as an OP-TEE TA.
- `oat-verify-engine`: OAT verify engine. It verifies the attestation blob with the application's binary and trace. 
- `oat-evaluation`: OAT evaluation programs, `-orig` is the unmodified version of the code, `-cb` is the modified version (annotated) ready for compilation/instrumentation.
- `oat-test`: Some test programs for the OAT compiler. Test OAT-compiler's support for instrumentation, annotation, and c++ code.

## Requirements

- Install OAT-Compiler on a server with enough memory, as recompilation of the OAT-Compiler needs large memory. (OAT-Compiler is based on LLVM-4.0.0, Server runs Ubuntu 16.04.)
- [HiKey (LeMaker version)][3](HiKey 620) with Debian OS installed.
- Install OP-TEE OS(OP-TEE 2.0) on the HiKey board. OP-TEE used to have support for Debian OS on HiKey board (with OP-TEE 2.0), now it only support AOSP. See an old issue [here][13] for more details.
- Install OP-TEE OS and TA compilation environment on the development server(or desktop), so that you can recompile the TA or TEE OS when needed, see [Tips for TA](https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building/trusted_applications.html). 
- Install a native Arm64 gcc compiler on the Hikey board to compile embedded applications locally.

## Workflow

- Prepare: Given an evaluation program, select the operation (a code piece that performs some critical functionality) you want to attest, and annotate the critical variables. 
- Trampoline Library: Build the TEE Client library and the trampoline library.
- Compile: Compile the code with the OAT-Compiler into Arm64 assembly code on the server where OAT-Compiler is installed, then compile the assembly code and link it with pre-built trampoline library on the target device (HiKey Board in our case).
- Install TA: Compile and install measurement engine as an OP-TEE TA on the HiKey Board.
- Run the evaluation program on HiKey Board. Make sure tee-supplicant is launched and TA can be called.
- Collect the attestation blob. For ease of verification, the trace of indirect branch and conditional branch are printed out to a file, which you can use for the verification.
- Verify the blob. Verify the attestation blob with the verify engine, the binary of the evaluation program is also needed.

## Note

- The evaluation programs are modified (sometimes tailored to keep the key operations for evaluation) when necessary to work in a way that it periodically perform a operation, mimicking the non-stop embedded programs deployed remotely.
- We do not sign the attestation blob for this prototype and only store them as secure objects.
- The OAT-Compiler's support for Pointer-based Access based on SoftBound is not fully functional, and is currently commented out.
- The Makefile of each directory contains rich information about how each part is compiled and used.
- The OP-TEE and LLVM repo that we base on are a bit old as this project started early. Another way to use this repo is to port the code to newer version.


## Credits: 

- This project is inspired by [C-FLAT][2] and [SoftBound][8].
- The taint analysis and points-to analysis used in OAT-Compiler is benefited from the [DR.CHECKER paper][12]
- [BLAKE2][9] cryptographic hash function. Inherited the ported
  the version of [reference implementation of BLAKE2s][10] from [C-FLAT][2]. 
- Verification engine is based on "The Ultimate Disassembler" [Capstone Engine][11].
- Evaluation programs are from github: [alarm4pi][4], [light-controller][5], [rc][6], [roverpi][7].
